up# DCC Custom - Development Notes

## Project Overview
Dungeon Crawler World character sheet application with beautiful visual character cards for sharing and offline reference.

**Live URL:** https://dcc-custom.vercel.app/

## Recent Major Development: Visual Character Card System

### Background
- **Original Issue:** QR code sharing system had "undefined" alert warnings
- **Solution Evolution:** 
  1. Initially replaced QR system with steganography-based character cards
  2. **DECISION CHANGE (Aug 22, 2025):** Abandoned steganography/QR scanning approach
  3. **Current Approach:** Simple JSON export/import + Beautiful visual character cards as "offline player sheets"
- **Rationale:** Save files are small enough that complex embedding isn't needed. Visual cards serve as beautiful references rather than data storage.

### Current Character Card System

#### Purpose Shift
- **From:** Data embedding and extraction system
- **To:** Beautiful visual "offline player sheets" for sharing and reference
- **Export/Import:** Standard JSON files with custom `.dcw` extension (Dungeon Crawler World)
- **Visual Cards:** Gorgeous themed character representations for social sharing and offline reference

### Major Updates (August 21-22, 2025)

#### ðŸŽ¨ Layout Selection System
- **4 Card Formats:** Users can now choose from multiple card layouts:
  - **Portrait Card:** Social media friendly with character portrait and key stats
  - **Stat Sheet:** Compact detailed statistics view
  - **Full Character Sheet:** Complete sheet with classic D&D graphing paper background
  - **Combat Card:** Quick combat reference with HP, weapons, and spells
- **Preview System:** Beautiful modal with visual previews of each layout option
- **Dynamic Generation:** Each layout has custom canvas sizing and themed styling

#### ðŸ“± Mobile App Integration
- **Cordova Setup:** Complete mobile app structure in `/Cordova/DCWorld/` folder
- **Android Ready:** Fully configured for Android app building and testing
- **PWA Enhancements:** Better iOS support with proper meta tags and apple-touch-icons
- **User Testing:** Android testers gave extremely positive feedback

#### ðŸŽ® Enhanced User Interface
- **Header Button Additions:**
  - Roll History Button: Quick access to dice roll history modal
  - Status Effects Button: Quick access to status effects modal
- **Modal System Improvements:**
  - Layout Selection Modal with visual previews
  - Roll History Modal for viewing dice rolls
  - Status Effects Modal for managing character conditions
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Better navigation for mobile users

#### ðŸ”§ Technical Infrastructure
- **QR Code Scanner:** New implementation with `qr-scanner.js` and fallback support
- **Test System:** Test characters and backup files in `/test_chars/` folder
- **File Organization:** Better structure for cross-platform development

### Steganography Implementation Details

#### Visual Card Technology
- **Method:** Canvas-based rendering of beautiful themed character cards
- **Purpose:** Visual sharing and offline player reference sheets
- **Export Format:** Standard JSON files with `.dcw` extension (Dungeon Crawler World)
- **File Location:** `/qr.js` (contains layout generation system, name kept for legacy reasons)

#### Key Functions in qr.js
1. **`generateCharacterCard()`** - Main entry point for card generation
2. **`determineCardStyle()`** - Selects theme based on character attributes
3. **`showLayoutSelectionModal()`** - Layout selection interface
4. **`generateSelectedLayout()`** - Generates specific card format
5. **Themed drawing functions:**
   - `drawMagicalCard()` - Purple/mystical theme
   - `drawWarriorCard()` - Red/brown warrior theme
   - `drawTechCard()` - Blue/cyan tech theme
   - `drawNatureCard()` - Green/brown nature theme
   - `drawClassicCard()` - Gold/cream default theme
6. **Layout drawing functions:**
   - `drawPortraitCard()` - Social media friendly format
   - `drawStatSheetCard()` - Compact statistics format
   - `drawFullSheetCard()` - Complete character sheet
   - `drawCombatCard()` - Combat reference format

#### Character Card Features
- **Portrait Integration:** Extracts character portrait from DOM element `#portrait-display`
- **Themed Styling:** 5 different visual themes based on character class/race/background
- **Multiple Layouts:** 4 card formats (Portrait, Stat Sheet, Full Sheet, Combat Card)
- **Decorative Elements:** Theme-specific borders, icons, and visual effects
- **Stat Display:** Formatted character attributes with visual enhancements
- **URL Branding:** Shows `dcc-custom.vercel.app` at bottom
- **Offline Reference:** Beautiful cards serve as offline player sheets for gaming sessions

#### Theme Detection Logic
```javascript
// Themes assigned based on character attributes:
// - Magical: wizard, sorcerer, warlock, druid classes OR elf, gnome races
// - Warrior: fighter, barbarian, paladin, monk classes OR dwarf, orc races  
// - Tech: hacker, engineer, pilot classes OR cyborg, android races
// - Nature: druid class OR elf (if not magical), nature backgrounds
// - Classic: Default fallback theme
```

### Technical Implementation Notes

#### Visual Card System Details
- **Rendering:** Canvas-based drawing with theme-specific styling
- **Output Format:** PNG images for sharing and offline reference
- **Save/Load:** Standard JSON files with `.dcw` extension (Dungeon Crawler World)
- **Simplicity:** Direct file export/import - no complex encoding needed
- **User Experience:** Visual cards serve as beautiful offline player sheets for gaming sessions

#### File Structure (Updated)
```
/qr.js - Visual card generation system (legacy filename, no longer QR-related)
/qr-scanner.js - *(Legacy file, may be removed)*
/jsqr-fallback.js - *(Legacy file, may be removed)*
/index.html - Enhanced modal system with layout selection
/style.css - Enhanced modal positioning and layout previews
/character-manager.js - Character data management
/main.js - Core application logic
/Cordova/DCWorld/ - Complete mobile app structure
/test_chars/ - Test characters and backups (.dcw files)
/markdown_readme/ - Development documentation
```

#### Save/Load System
- **Export Format:** JSON files with `.dcw` extension (Dungeon Crawler World)
- **Import:** Direct JSON loading - simple and reliable
- **File Size:** Small enough that complex encoding unnecessary
- **Visual Cards:** Generated as PNG images for offline reference, not data storage
- **Functions:** 
  - `exportCharacterToJSON()` - Creates `.dcw` files
  - `loadCharacterFromStorage()` - Loads `.dcw` files
  - `shareCharacterAsCard()` - Creates visual reference cards

### System Architecture Decision (August 22, 2025)

#### Why We Abandoned Steganography/QR Scanning
- **File Size Reality:** Character save files are small enough (typically < 50KB) that complex embedding is unnecessary
- **User Experience:** Direct `.dcw` file export/import is simpler and more reliable
- **Maintenance:** Steganography adds complexity without real benefit
- **Visual Cards Purpose:** Changed from data storage to beautiful offline reference sheets

#### Current Approach
- **Save/Load:** Simple JSON files with `.dcw` extension (Dungeon Crawler World format)
- **Visual Cards:** Beautiful themed PNG images for sharing and offline gaming reference
- **Simplicity:** No encoding/decoding complexity - just generate gorgeous visual representations

### Character Data Structure
Character object includes:
- Basic info (name, level, age, portrait)
- Race/heritage with custom bonuses
- Background/job information  
- Class with abilities
- 6 core attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA)
- Skills, spells, equipment
- Story/backstory text
- Current HP/MP values

### Development Environment Setup
- **IDE:** VS Code with AI Chat
- **Git:** Repository synced across multiple machines
- **Deployment:** Vercel automatic deployment
- **Testing:** Browser-based testing + Android app testing
- **Mobile:** Cordova framework for Android/iOS builds

### Android App Success! ðŸŽ‰
- **Tester Feedback:** "LOVED the android app, far more than expected"
- **Mobile-First Design:** Layout selection and quick-access buttons work perfectly on mobile
- **Performance:** Smooth operation on Android devices
- **User Experience:** Intuitive navigation and beautiful card generation

### Known Issues
- None currently - system stable and well-received by testers

### Next Session Preparation
When resuming development:
1. Load this file for context
2. Address any UI tweaks based on user feedback
3. Consider app store preparation
4. Focus on steganography extraction if needed (lower priority)
