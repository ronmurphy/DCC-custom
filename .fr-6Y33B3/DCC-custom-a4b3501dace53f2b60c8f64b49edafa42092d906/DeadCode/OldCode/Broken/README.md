# Uniform DCC Character Sheet - Merged Version

This directory contains the **unified version** that merges the working functionality from the V3-backup with the enhanced styling from the current V3 version.

## What Was Merged

### From V3-backup (Working Features)
- ✅ **Direct DOM insertion approach**: Buttons inserted directly into `inventory-grid` and `spells-grid`
- ✅ **Simple onclick handlers**: Direct `onclick` assignment that works across all devices
- ✅ **Reliable button creation**: Uses `insertBefore(button, firstChild)` for consistent placement

### From Current V3 (Enhanced Features)  
- ✅ **Enhanced modal styling**: Uses `level-up-modal-overlay` and `level-up-modal-content` classes
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive design**: Proper modal header/body/footer structure
- ✅ **Escape key handling**: Close modals with Escape key
- ✅ **Click-outside-to-close**: Modal closes when clicking the overlay
- ✅ **Material Design icons**: Consistent icon usage throughout

## Key Changes Made

### Button Implementation (From Backup)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Current V3 - Not Working)
const addItemSection = document.querySelector('#inventory .add-item-section');
// Complex selector targeting specific form sections

// AFTER (Unified - Working)  
const inventoryGrid = document.getElementById('inventory-grid');
// Direct targeting of grid containers
```

### Click Handler Assignment (From Backup)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Current V3 - Not Working)
dccButton.innerHTML = `<button onclick="showDCCWeaponTemplates()">...`;
// Onclick in innerHTML

// AFTER (Unified - Working)
templatesBtn.onclick = showDCCWeaponTemplates;  
// Direct onclick assignment
```

### Modal Styling (From Current V3)
```javascript
// Enhanced modal structure maintained
modal.className = 'modal level-up-modal-overlay';
modal.innerHTML = `
    <div class="modal-content level-up-modal-content">
        <div class="modal-header level-up-header">...
```

## File Structure
- `test.html` - Test page to verify functionality
- `improvements.js` - Unified implementation with working buttons + enhanced modals
- All other files copied from current V3 version

## Testing
Open `test.html` in a browser and verify:
1. ✅ DCC Book Weapons button appears in Gear tab
2. ✅ DCC Book Spells button appears in Magic tab  
3. ✅ Buttons are clickable on both mobile and desktop
4. ✅ Modals open with enhanced styling
5. ✅ Modals close with Escape key or click outside

## Next Steps
If testing confirms functionality:
1. Copy working `improvements.js` back to main V3 directory
2. Deploy to production
3. Remove V3-backup and Uniform directories after confirmation
